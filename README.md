# Data Hunch Demo

**View the prototype deployment here: [Data Hunch Demo](http://vdl.sci.utah.edu/data-hunch/)**

## About

Welcome to the the demonstrator for the paper [Data Hunches: Incorporating Personal Knowledge into Visualizations](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/publications/2021_preprint_data-hunches/). 

A <ins>**data hunch**</ins> is an analyst's knowledge about how and why the data is an imperfect and partial representation of the phenomena of interest.

In this demonstrator, we show some ideas how data hunches could be recorded and visualized, on top of but distinct from data visualizations.

Browse through the different types of demonstration hunches we pre-recorded, or try recording some of your own by right-clicking a bar or using one of the buttons.

To record a data hunch, use the "**Continue as Guest**" feature on the top right. Note that we do not track anything about visitors to this website!
